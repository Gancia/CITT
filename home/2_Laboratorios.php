                                    But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and
                                    praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and
                                    expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder
                                    of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it
                                    is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally
                                    encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who
                                    loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but
                                    because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some
                                    great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
                                    physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to
                                    find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying
                                    consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? On the
                                    other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so
                                    beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by
                                    desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and
                                    equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which
                                    is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.
                                </p>

                                    These cases are
                                    perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice
                                    is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best,
                                    every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
                                    circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
                                    frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The
                                    wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he
                                    rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
                                    avoid worse pains. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of
                                    denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete
                                    account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the
